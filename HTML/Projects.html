        These examples are all from my time at UCL. I am still improving my work from day to day, since i work <br class="br-mobile">

        <p>Project 1 - Dating App</p>
            <img src="../IMG/cnct.png">
            <p> For this project we were spread out into group that then had to develop a concept <br class="br-mobile">
                for at dating app. We had to find out target group for this daiting app, so it <br class="br-mobile"> 
                would make it easier for us to design a good app. We chose to work with people in <br class="br-mobile">
                the age group from 18-25 years old. This target group was selected since we were in <br class="br-mobile"> 
                this group and there for knew a bit more about what should be in a app of this caliber <br class="br-mobile"> 
                and on top of that, we felt that there weren't any good aps out there for the things we <br class="br-mobile"> 
                were looking for. The idea of this app would be to connect people who has the same intrest <br class="br-mobile">
                that way you would have somthing in common, which would help with having a topic to<br class="br-mobile"> 
                start of with, and then work from there. We also made this app not only for daiting <br class="br-mobile"> 
                but also just to make connections between people, so you can use the app to find friends as well <br>

        <p>Project 2 - Redesign Of Website</p>
            <p> In project 2, we were once again spread into groups to work togehter on finding a <br class="br-mobile">
                website that we felt could use a makeover, to make it more relevent and better looking <br class="br-mobile"> 
                I made the decion to start looking at hobby website in Odense, since they rarely have <br class="br-mobile"> 
                an updated website, it is mostly there to have some information on it. We found a website <br class="br-mobile">
                for Odense Model Train, which was in a big need of an update, so we called our target group <br class="br-mobile"> 
                to hear what they would want on their website what they felt was missing. After we talked to <br class="br-mobile"> 
                one of the members we had a good idea of what to work on. We made an updated website in Adobe XD <br class="br-mobile"> 
                so they could see what our idea for the website was, we also used that Adobe XD file to show to the <br class="br-mobile"> 
                class and talk about our thougt process.

            <p>This report follows the focus points and overall mission of Økolariet experience and science center. <br class="br-mobile">
                Their primary objective is to educate guests about environmental changes, sustainability and climate change. <br class="br-mobile">
                Mostly relating to the localised surrounding areas of Vejle Fjord. To further knowledge and insight <br class="br-mobile">
                the experience and science center uses installations to convey information in a fun and engaging way. <br class="br-mobile">
                Through research and analyzing the ecosystem in Vejle Fjord, this report will focus on designing <br class="br-mobile">
                an interactive media which will showcase one of the primary challenges of the ecosystem, 
                and how to improve it. <br class="br-mobile"> <br>

                Crabs has become a main trouble, with a heavy overpopulation and has skewed the balance in the <br class="br-mobile">
                relating links of the ecosystem. Therefore some kind of implementation must take place to hold down the <br class="br-mobile">
                populace and our interactive solution will explain the main benefits and reasons behind it. The solution <br class="br-mobile"> 
                aims to engage a younger audience to have fun while learning and have parents (or teachers) explain <br class="br-mobile">
                in detail the challenges behind the overpopulation of crabs in Vejle Fjord. Even down to a level of how it <br class="br-mobile">
                affects your everyday life. <br>
